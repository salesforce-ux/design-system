**CHANGES**
- All buttons are visually smaller.
- Form Elements are visually smaller.
- `slds-button--small` is deprecated (since buttons are now the same size as
  it was).
- `slds-input--small` is deprecated (since inputs are now the same size as it was).
- Refactored cards and picklist menu markup to no longer show
  `slds-button--small`. Since these are now the same height, leaving those
  classes in will no longer have any visual difference.
