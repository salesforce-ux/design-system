### [Datetime Picker](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/datetime-picker)
#### Changed
- Datetime Picker blueprints no longer use the deprecated variant `.slds-form_compound` on its parent `.slds-form`. Instead, it now uses `.slds-form-element_compound` on its parent `.slds-form-element`.

### [Form Element](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/form-element)
#### Changed
- The compound form now wraps when the width of its parent container is smaller than the combined width of the form elements. This prevents the issue of input values becoming cutoff and unreadable due to shrinking compound form elements in a container with a small width.
- When `.slds-form-element` is a child of `.slds-form-element_compound`, it now uses margins instead of padding for its horizontal spacing. This fixes the issue of dropdowns being incorrectly offset because the dropdown uses the extra space created by padding as its positioning reference.

## Big Impact

### [Component Blueprints](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/overview)
- Renamed our 'Components' to 'Component Blueprints' to create distinction between our SLDS Components and ([Lightning Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref.htm)). We define our 'Component Blueprints' as 'Framework agnostic, accessible HTML and CSS used to create components in conjunction with our implementation guidelines'. For more details, check out the glossary we added to our [FAQ page](/faq).

### [Form Layout](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/form-element/#Layout)
- Merged Form Layout into Form Element ([f3c5b48](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/commit/f3c5b48))

### [Icon](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/#utility)
- Addressed 2 issues with the usage of *Warning* and *Error* icons. ([cd98ab6](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/commit/cd98ab6))
    1) Research showed that the ban icon best represented an error for our users, so we switched the error and ban icons. The new error icon is the circle with a diagonal slash through it
    2) We also realized that we used the same icon for both error and warning states in many components, so we updated components that were using the warning icon in red as an error state to use the new error icon.

### [Lookup](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/components/lookups/)
- Deprecated `slds-lookup` and replaced with `slds-combobox` and `slds-combobox-group` ([2dbe619](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/commit/2dbe619))

## Big Impact

We've made several enhancements in the Winter ’18 release which might affect your components and pages.

### As a designer what do I need to know about the design changes in the Winter ‘18 release?
- We’ve enhanced font hierarchy to draw attention to what's most important in the moment and improve legibility.
- We’ve condensed the spacing of content (from 16px to 12px) to allow more information on the page. You’ll especially notice this in the tightening of data tables.
- We've added layering and a colorful graphics to the layout to create contrast between foreground and background cards. The cards have white backgrounds and drop shadows, while the page background introduces color.
- The components we’ve updated are cards, avatar, data tables, and page headers.
- For more detailed information, please visit this Salesforce UX blog post: [Evolving the Lightning User Experience](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/evolving-the-lightning-user-experience-5f1de21f7af)

### As a developer what do I need to know about the design changes in the Winter ‘18 release?
- With the changes to the page background color, you may notice some of your custom components are transparent, rendering the text on the dark background. You can fix that easily by adding the class `.slds-card` to the outer wrapper of your component.
- If you need default tabs to appear to be in a card, you can place the `.slds-tabs_card` class on the `.slds-tabs_default` DOM node. This will give the tabset padding and drop-shadows like a card.
- When the `.slds-card` class is used inside `.slds-tabs_default`, `.slds-modal`, or another `.slds-card`, they no longer have the drop-shadow card look. Instead they are simply white. In some situations, you may need to differentiate your card from content around it. You can add the `.slds-card_boundary` class to the `.slds-card` for a rounded border.
- On some pages, you’ll notice the header is attached to a list view. If you have a custom page where you’d like to attach the header to a component below, add the `.slds-has-bottom-magnet` class to the `slds-page-header`. Then add `.slds-has-top-magnet` to the component below. This will visually attach the components to each other.
- If you have been using SLDS in Visualforce via the `<apex:slds />` tag, your Visualforce pages will also inherit the new styling in Winter ’18

## Release 2.3.1 - May 25, 2017

## Big Impact

### BEM naming change

Initially we used the double dash style for BEM notation (`--`). Due to the fact that double dashes are problematic in an XML environment (which doesn't allow double dashes within comments), we have upgraded our syntax to use the single underscore style (`_`). This change is backward compatible for 18 months. But all components going forward are built with the single underscore BEM style.

* Removed dotted underline for `abbr` that Chrome introduced in version 58

### 🗒 Notes About Scoped CSS files, the Unmanaged Package, Visualforce and Lightning Components

The Lightning Design System CSS is now automatically included for Lightning Components running in the Lightning Experience and Salesforce S1 mobile application (via `app.css`). It is no longer necessary to add a static resource for Lightning Components running within these environments.

Starting in 2.0.x, the Lightning Design System is no longer available as an unmanaged package. Also, the scoped CSS files (`salesforce-lightning-design-system-vf.css` and `salesforce-lightning-design-system-ltng.css`) are no longer distributed as part of the Design System zip file (available in the [Downloads](/downloads/) page). As an alternative, you may now generate your own scoped Design System zip file using the new [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer) and upload it as a static resource as documented on the tool’s page. However, we strongly recommend that you do not install SLDS as a static resource when building for Lightning.

Resources:

- [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer)
- [Using SLDS in Lightning](/platforms/lightning/)
- [Using SLDS in Visualforce](/platforms/visualforce/)

## Release [1.0.5] - May 26, 2016

This change addresses [#203](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/203)
- Improved accessibility of the [breadcrumbs component](/components/breadcrumbs/)
- The Design System now allows developers to load Salesforce webfonts using their preferred method instead of the default `@font-face` rules. To disable the default font loading method, set `$slds-load-webfonts: false;` before importing the Design System Sass file.
- The project is now compatible with Node.js 6
- Search! You can now get faster to components and the deepest parts of the documentation using the search field at the top of the navigation

## Release [1.0.4] - May 18, 2016

- Added `title` attributes to icon containers, noticeably improving accessibility for users of pointing devices such as mice and trackpads
- Improved the structure of the [icon component](/components/icons) section, making it easier for you to discover how to decorate your Lightning apps with our beautiful icons
- Fixed the standard call icon, which gets its fancy yellow background back, instead of a purple one that had been assigned to it for obscure reasons (we’ve put our best designers on the case!)
- Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/208) where `npm install` would fail on Windows - which is only fair to our developer friends who are on PCs

## Release [1.0.3] - April 26, 2016

- Fixed Sass build issue for npm module

## Release [1.0.2] - April 8, 2016

- Added a link to an [archive of v1.0.0](https://design-system-v-1-0-0.herokuapp.com/), so you can access the documentation and downloads for that previous version
- Generated the unmanaged package for the 1.0.2 patch release

- Changed `.slds-tooltip` to `.slds-popover_tooltip`, `.slds-tooltip` will become deprecated (*).
- Deprecated `.slds-has-divider` (*), now requires a top or bottom direction appened, e.g. `.slds-has-divider_top`, `.slds-has-divider_bottom`
- Deprecated "Menu with Icons" dropdown variant
  - No longer depends on class names that deal with icon positioning
  - `.slds-dropdown__item` are set to `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between` by default now. This allows for icon + text to be left aligned and a single icon to be positioned on the same axis to the right hand side. The icon + text that is positioned to the left requires an HTML element, like a `<p>` with the class `.slds-truncate` applied.
  - `.slds-has-icon`, `.slds-has-icon_left`, `.slds-has-icon_right` and children classes `.slds-icon_left`, `.slds-icon_right` have been deprecated but will persist in code base (*)
  - If user invokes selection on a dropdown item and wants feedback such a a checkmark, that SVG now requires a class of `.slds-icon_selected`
- <em> (*) Code is still in codebase but will be deprecated, TBD but preliminary removal of release 0.20.0</em>

### BREAKING CHANGES
