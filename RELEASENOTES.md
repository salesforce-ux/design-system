**BREAKING CHANGES**

- Changed `.slds-tooltip` to `.slds-popover--tooltip`, `.slds-tooltip` will become deprecated (*).

 - `.slds-dropdown__item` are set to `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between` by default now. This allows for icon + text to be left aligned and a single icon to be positioned on the same axis to the right hand side. The icon + text that is positioned to the left requires an HTML element, like a `<p>` with the class `.slds-truncate` applied.
