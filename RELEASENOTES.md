##### Salesforce Lightning Design System - Release notes

<!-- Release notes authoring guidelines: http://keepachangelog.com/ -->

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->
## **Release [2.3.1] - May 25, 2017**

## Big Impact

**BEM naming change**

Initially we used the double dash style for BEM notation (`--`). Due to the fact that double dashes are problematic in an XML environment (which doesn't allow double dashes within comments), we have upgraded our syntax to use the single underscore style (`_`). This change is backward compatible for 18 months. But all components going forward are built with the single underscore BEM style.

## Fixes

The following issues have now been resolved:

* Removed dotted underline for `abbr` that Chrome introduced in version 58
* Fix issue on Spinner component where Firefox and IE11 wouldn't respect its z-index token
* Fix line-height issue on `slds-form-element__static` when the output was multi-line
* Fix BEM naming convention on visibility classes - [#452](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/452)

**🗒 Notes About Scoped CSS files, the Unmanaged Package, Visualforce and Lightning Components**

The Lightning Design System CSS is now automatically included for Lightning Components running in the Lightning Experience and Salesforce S1 mobile application (via `app.css`). It is no longer necessary to add a static resource for Lightning Components running within these environments.

Starting in 2.0.x, the Lightning Design System is no longer available as an unmanaged package. Also, the scoped CSS files (`salesforce-lightning-design-system-vf.css` and `salesforce-lightning-design-system-ltng.css`) are no longer distributed as part of the Design System zip file (available in the [Downloads](/downloads/) page). As an alternative, you may now generate your own scoped Design System zip file using the new [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer) and upload it as a static resource as documented on the tool’s page. However, we strongly recommend that you do not install SLDS as a static resource when building for Lightning.

Resources:

- [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer)
- [Using SLDS in Lightning](/platforms/lightning/)
- [Using SLDS in Visualforce](/platforms/visualforce/)

## Release [1.0.5] - May 26, 2016

This change addresses [#203](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/203)
- Improved accessibility of the [breadcrumbs component](/components/breadcrumbs/)
- The Design System now allows developers to load Salesforce webfonts using their preferred method instead of the default `@font-face` rules. To disable the default font loading method, set `$slds-load-webfonts: false;` before importing the Design System Sass file.
- The project is now compatible with Node.js 6
- Search! You can now get faster to components and the deepest parts of the documentation using the search field at the top of the navigation

## Release [1.0.4] - May 18, 2016

- Added `title` attributes to icon containers, noticeably improving accessibility for users of pointing devices such as mice and trackpads
- Improved the structure of the [icon component](/components/icons) section, making it easier for you to discover how to decorate your Lightning apps with our beautiful icons
- Fixed the standard call icon, which gets its fancy yellow background back, instead of a purple one that had been assigned to it for obscure reasons (we’ve put our best designers on the case!)
- Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/208) where `npm install` would fail on Windows - which is only fair to our developer friends who are on PCs

## Release [1.0.3] - April 26, 2016

- Fixed Sass build issue for npm module

## Release [1.0.2] - April 8, 2016
