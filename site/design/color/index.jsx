      <p className="site-text-introduction">Salesforce uses a specific color palette to communicate meaning, convey visual differentiation, and provide a consistent look and feel. From neutrals to brights, each hue is chosen to fit into the overall visual language and promote a contemporary and vibrant user experience.</p>

      {/* Neutral Colors */}
      <h2 className="site-text-heading--large">Neutrals</h2>
      <p>Salesforce uses cool-toned greys injected with a hint of blue to create a lively and modern mood for the interface. In general, color is used sparingly to keep the content center stage and not distract end users.</p>

      {/* Primary Colors */}
      <h2 className="site-text-heading--large">Primary Colors</h2>
      <p>Salesforce’s primary brand colour is a bright, friendly orange. We also use some darker blues for various other use cases.</p>

      </figure>

      {/* Secondary Colors */}
      <h2 className="site-text-heading--large">Secondary Colors</h2>
      <p>We use a broad range of secondary colors that complement the neutral and primary colors. The level of saturation is vibrant but not neon, mellow but not muted.</p>

          <h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--medium p-top--x-large')}>Visual Messaging</h2>
          <p>Certain colors have inherent meaning for a large majority of users, although we recognize that cultural differences are plentiful. For example, we use red to communicate an error.</p>
        </div>
        <figure className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--1-of-3 shrink-none')}>
          <img className={pf('image')} src="/assets/images/color/img-messaging.svg" alt="" />

      {/* Visual Differentiation */}
      <div className={pf('site-side-by-side grid wrap m-bottom--x-large')}>
        <div className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--2-of-3 grow-none')}>
          <h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--medium p-top--x-large')}>Visual Differentiation</h2>
          <p>Salesforce uses many secondary colors in conjunction with iconography to visually differentiate between similar types of content, such as records of different object types. However, it’s important to not always rely on color to provide visual differentiation. If too many use cases employ color in this manner, the colors lose their meaning.</p>
        </div>
        <figure className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--1-of-3 shrink-none')}>
          <img className={pf('image')} src="/assets/images/color/img-differentiation.svg" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>

      {/* Visual Hierarchy */}
      <div className={pf('site-side-by-side grid wrap m-bottom--x-large')}>
        <div className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--2-of-3 grow-none')}>
          <h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--medium p-top--x-large')}>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
          <p>Color is used sparingly to draw attention to important elements and those that we want the user to take action on. Because most of the application is gray, pops of color catch a user’s eye.</p>
        </div>
        <figure className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--1-of-3 shrink-none')}>
          <img className={pf('image')} src="/assets/images/color/img-hierarchy.svg" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>

      {/* Accessibility */}
      <div className={pf('site-side-by-side grid wrap m-bottom--x-large')}>
        <div className={pf('size--1-of-1 medium-size--2-of-3 grow-none')}>
          <h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--medium p-top--x-large')}>Accessibility</h2>
          <p>It’s important that our products meet all web accessibility standards, including the minimum contrast ratios that the WCAG 2.0 specifies for text and background color combinations. This adherence helps users who are colorblind or have low vision to better interact with Salesforce, but it also improves usability and readability for all users.</p>
          <p>You can find some of the most common text and background color combinations in the CSS Framework Themes section. They are all vetted to pass the minimum contrast ratios, including both normal text and link text styles.</p>
