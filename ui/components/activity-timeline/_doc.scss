/**
 * Each Activity timeline item receives its width from the parent list. It can
 * consume the full width of the main page area or be placed in the smaller right
 * sidebar.
 *
 * Note: This new version of activity timeline allows for expandable detail sections on each timeline item. The static version is still supported.
 *
 * ##### Accessibility
 *
 * Text describing the type of timeline item is placed in a `span`. It is the
 * first element in the timeline item and should be hidden with the
 * `.slds-assistive-text` class. The `SVG` image does not need the
 * `.slds-assistive-text` class.
 *
 * #### Notable attributes
 *
 * **Button:**
 * - `aria-controls` is used to create an association between the button and the details section. If the details section has an `id="email-content"`, then the button should have `aria-controls="email-content"`.
 * - The title of the timeline item can also be used as a button to open the details section. If the details section has an `id="email-content"`, then the div with `slds-timeline__trigger` should have `aria-controls="email-content"` and the click handler.
 * - `aria-expanded` indicates if the details section is open or closed and is read aloud by assitive technology when the button is focused.
 *
 * **Section:**
 * - `aria-hidden` indicates if the details section is open or closed, and if set to `true`, assistive technology hides the details section.
 *
 * ##### Keyboard navigation
 * - The button should behave as a normal button. The user should be able to tab to focus it and press enter/space to activate it.
 *
 * #### Updating Operation and State
 * - When the user interacts with the button to open the details section, `aria-expanded` on the button should be `true` and `aria-hidden` on the details section should be `false`.
 * - When the user interacts with the button to close the details section, `aria-expanded` on the button should be `false` and `aria-hidden` on the details section should be `true`.
 *
