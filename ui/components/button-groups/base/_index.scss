// The .slds-button--last class should be placed on the wrapper
// of a button that's the final one in a button-group
//
// A bit of history:
//
// Button-groups were originally built to have no wrappers in their midst.
//
// And all buttons happily coexisted perfectly in the land of :last-child...
// but then along came the big bad, "Buttons in a group can come from all
// different teams and some are wrapped to contain a dropdown, etc.
// This code doesn't work now."
//
// There was much booing and hissing and stamping of feet.
//
// Then, Pragmatism reared its head and suggested, "Hey guys, maybe we have
// to supply a way for people to indicate when a button is the last one."
//
// We had situations where various buttons were wrapped and everyone believed
// it was the :last-child, or no one did. So the last button had to raise its
// hand and shout loudly, "I am .button--last!".
//
// Then there were issues where the last button could be wearing a wrap, thus
// the class actually needed to be placed on it's cute little sweater instead.
//
// And the poor little button became warm indeed. And it got a little smelly.
//
// Sometimes Pragmatism wins and sometimes she loses. This time she won.
//
// The end of the story of button-groups.
