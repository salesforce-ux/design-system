  // This class should be placed on the wrapper
  // of a button that's the final one in a button-group
  //
  // A bit of history:
  //
  // Button-groups were originally built to have no wrappers in their midst.
  //
  // And all buttons happily coexisted perfectly in the land of :last-child...
  // but then along came the big bad, "Buttons in a group can come from all
  // different teams and some are wrapped to contain a dropdown, etc.
  // This code doesn't work now."
  //
  // There was much booing and hissing and stamping of feet.
  //
  // Then, Pragmatism reared its head and suggested, "Hey guys, maybe we have
  // to supply a way for people to indicate when a button is the last one."
  //
  // We had situations where various buttons were wrapped and everyone believed
  // it was the :last-child, or no one did. So the last button had to raise its
  // hand and shout loudly, "I am .button--last!".
  //
  // Then there were issues where the last button could be wearing a wrap, thus
  // the class actually needed to be placed on it's cute little sweater instead.
  //
  // And the poor little button became warm indeed. And it got a little smelly.
  //
  // Sometimes Pragmatism wins and sometimes she loses. This time she won.
  //
  // The end of the story of button-groups.
