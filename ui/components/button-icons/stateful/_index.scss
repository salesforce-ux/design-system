/**
 * The stateful button requires the `.slds-button--icon-border` class in addition to the `.slds-button` class.
 *
 * The stateful inverse button works just like the stateful button. It requires the `.slds-button--icon-border-inverse` class in addition to the `.slds-button` class.
 *
 * Stateful icons can be toggled on and off and retain their state. JavaScript is used to add the `.slds-is-selected` class to the button when activated.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * For accessibility, implement the [ARIA Toggle Button](http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#button) concept.
 * - Similar to a mute button, the button represents a pressed or unpressed state.
 * - Button text doesn't change per state
 * - `aria-pressed` is set to `true` or `false`, depending its state
 *
 * @summary Stateful Button Icon
 * @name stateful
 * @selector .slds-is-selected
 * @restrict .slds-button_icon
 * @variant
