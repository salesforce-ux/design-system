/**
 * The ability to style checkboxes with CSS varies across browsers.
 * To ensure that checkboxes look the same everywhere, we use a custom DOM.
 * Pay close attention to the markup, because all elements must exist for the
 * styles to work.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Groups of checkboxes should be marked up using the fieldset and legend
 * element. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand the
 * question they're answering with the group of checkboxes. The fieldset is
 * placed around the whole group and the legend contains the question.
 *
 * Custom checkboxes are created by applying the `.slds-checkbox` class to
 * a `<label>` element. To remain accessible to all user agents, place
 * `<input>` with `type="checkbox"` inside the `<label>` element.  The `<input>`
 * is then visually hidden, and the styling is placed on a span with
 * the `.slds-checkbox_faux` class. The styling of the span changes based
 * on whether the checkbox is selected or focused by using a pseudo-element.
 * A second span with `.slds-form-element__label` contains the label text.
 *
 * When a single checkbox is required, `<div class="slds-checkbox">` should
 * get `<abbr class="slds-required" title="required">*</abbr>` added to the DOM,
 * directly before the `<input type="checkbox" />` for visual indication
 * that the checkbox is required.
 *
 * When a checkbox group is required, the `<fieldset>` should receive the
 * class `.slds-is-required`. The `<legend>` should then get
 * `<abbr class="slds-required" title="required">*</abbr>` added to the DOM for
 * visual indication that the checkbox group is required.
 *
 * As SLDS checkboxes rely on the :checked psuedo selector, and the
 * indeterminate state is only accessible via JavaScript, the use of a
 * CSS class on the input will be necessary to implement this in SLDS.
 * Use JavaScript to add the class when the indeterminate property is set to
 * true on the input.
 *
 * The following JavaScript demonstrates how to set a checkbox to be indeterminate:
 * ```js
 * var checkbox = document.getElementById('checkbox-indeterminate-01');
 * checkbox.indeterminate = true;
 * ```
 *
 * @summary A checkable input that communicates if an option is true, false or indeterminate
 *
 * @base
 * @name checkbox
 * @selector .slds-checkbox
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category base
 * @type data-entry
 * @role checkbox
 * @layout responsive

 * @styling-hooks
