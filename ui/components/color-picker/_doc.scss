/**
 * The Unified Color Picker component allows for a fully accessible and configurable
 * color picker, allowing the user to pick from a set of predefined colors
 * (swatches), or to pick a custom color using a HSB selection interface.
 *
 * It can be configured to show one or both of those color selection interfaces.
 *
 * ### Implementation Guidelines
 *
 * The Color Picker is a dynamic component with several 'live' areas. These
 * areas need to update when certain user interactions occur.
 *
 * ##### **A quick note on terms**
 *
 * Several terms are used in this document, each with particular meaning. Please take note
 * of the following:
 *
 * - _**Need/s**_ This rule must be implemented for the component to appear or function as expected.
 * - _**Current color**_ The current selected, submitted, and validated color.
 * - _**Working color**_ The working, unsubmitted color, built with the custom-range tool.
 *
 * When creating an implementation of this UI component, please take note to include
 * the following functionality:
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__button`
 *
 * Aside from the 'swatches-only' variant, all Color Picker variants have a summary
 * section with a clickable button. This button _needs_ to toggle the visibility of the
 * `.slds-color-picker__selector` popover.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__button .slds-swatch`
 *
 * This swatch _needs_ an inline style of `background`, set to the _current color_.
 * It _needs_ to update whenever the _current color_ is updated.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__summary-input`
 *
 * This input _needs_ to display the hex value of the _current color_. It should update
 * whenever _current color_ is updated. The user can enter a hex color manually. The
 * implementation should check for the validity of the submitted value before setting
 * the color to be the _current color_.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__hue-slider`
 *
 * In the custom picker, the hue slider is a range input element that allows the user to
 * select a hue base for a _working color_. Its value ranges from 0 - 360, and represents the
 * hue in an expected hsv color format.
 *
 * When the user updates the _current color_, the value on this slider _needs_ to be adjusted
 * to the _current color_'s hue.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__custom-range`
 *
 * The custom range represents a matrix of all saturation and brightness combinations of
 * the _working color_'s hue. The x axis of the form represents saturation, and goes from
 * 0% to 100%. On the y axis, brightness is represented, with 0% brightness at the bottom,
 * and 100% brightness at the top.
 *
 * Keep in mind that when implementing color conversions, this custom range picker is utilizing
 * the HSB/HSV color model, and not the HSL model.
 *
 * This element _needs_ an inline style, with the `background` property set to the
 * _working color_'s hue, as defined by the hue range input element desctibed above. As this
 * element is meant to represent the current _working color_'s hue's saturation and lightness
 * matrix, css's hsl() syntax is the most appropriate format here, with the hue being the
 * current _working color_'s hue, the saturation set to 100% and the lightness set to 50%
 * (the 50% lightness is to adjust this HSL range for the HSB color model).
 *
 * A gradient overlay will produce the effect of the saturation and brightness matrix
 * automatically.
 *
 * Any mouse clicks on the custom range _need_ to set the position of the
 * `.slds-color-picker__range-indicator` to the clicked coordinates, and also _need_ to
 * update the saturation and brightness values on the working color.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__range-indicator`
 *
 * This is the targeting element inside the custom range, and represents the current
 * brightness and saturation values of the _working color_.
 *
 * It _needs_ declarations for `bottom` and `left` positioning, so it will be properly
 * placed over the correct area of the `.slds-color-picker__custom-range`.
 *
 * Conveniently, the values are uniformly represented. The `left` declaration indicates
 * the saturation value, from 0% to 100%, and the `bottom` declaration indicates
 * the brightness value, from 0% to 100%.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__hue-and-preview .slds-swatch`
 *
 * This swatch is a preview element of the _working color_ value from the hue slider
 * and range indicator above. It _needs_ an inline style for `background`, set to the
 * completed _working color_ value.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__custom-inputs`
 *
 * The Hex, R(ed), G(reen), and B(lue) text inputs included in this section are
 * representative of the current _working color_'s converted Hex or RGB values, and
 * _need_ to display those as their value.
 *
 * Users can, however, directly input into these elements. A valid entry _needs_ to
 * update the working color and update related elements. The implementation should
 * protect against invalid submissions.
 *
 * ### Expected Keyboard Interactions
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatches`
 *
 * This element has the role of `listbox`, and keyboard interactions when its &lt;a&gt;
 * children are focused _needs_ to behave in a menu-like fashion. Keypresses _need_
 * to move the actively focused element in the appropriate direction (left/up will move
 * to the previous item, down/right will move to the next item).
 *
 * Additionally, when focused on the first or last item, the appropriate key action
 * _needs_ to move the focus to the last or first item, respectively. It is expected
 * to behave in a cyclical fashion.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__range-indicator`
 *
 * The range indicator, when focused, _needs_ to respond to arrow keypresses by moving
 * 1% in the appropriate direction, unless prohibited by a boundary.
 *
 * For an additional effect, if an arrow key is pressed in combination with shift,
 * the indicator can move 10% in the given direction, unless prohibited by a boundary.
 *
 * #### Other Interactions
 *
 * Other expected keyboard interactions (such as input field updates) and their effects
 * on UI can be found in the Implementation Guidelines section above.
 *
 * ### Accessibility Guidelines
 *
 * As this is a highly interactive component, there are some key accessibility
 * guidelines that must be followed.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__summary-label`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a for attribute with the value of the
 * `.slds-color-picker__summary-input`'s ID
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatches`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a `role` of `listbox `.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatch`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a `role` of `presentation`.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatch-trigger`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a `role` of `option`.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__range-indicator`
 *
 * Since this element is focused and moved to indicate the _working color_ it _needs_
 * proper aria tags to indicate its job and value. First, an `aria-live` attribute
 * _needs_ to be set to `assertive`, `aria-atomic` _needs_ to be set to `true`, and
 * `aria-describedby` needs to reference the instructions text for the custom color
 * picker range, which in our example is the hidden `#color-picker-instructions`
 * element.
 *
 * #### All Other Accessibility
 *
 * This component makes use of other components, such as Popovers, Tabs, and Input.
 * All accessibility rules and guidelines for those components _need_ to be followed
 * for proper accessibility support.
