/**
 * #### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 *
 * The datepicker has the following markup requirements:
 *
 * **Desktop**
 * - Add `.slds-is-open` to the element with `.slds-dropdown-trigger` to invoke the dropdown that contains the datepicker.
 * - The `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `td` element that has the selected day.
 * - The `.slds-is-today` modifier class is required on the `td` element that is the current day.
 * - The `.slds-has-multi-selection` modifier class is required on the `tr` element that contains multiple days selected in the **same** week.
 * - The `.slds-has-multi-row-selection` modifier class is required on any `tr` element that contains multiple days selected in the **multiple** weeks.
 * - The `.slds-is-selected-multi` modifier class is required on the `td` element that contains a selected day within a range.
 *
 * **Mobile**
 * - When on mobile, we want to leverage the native date picker by changing the `input` type from `text` to `date`
 * - The `input type="date"` will create an input field allowing a date and time to be easily entered — this includes year, month, day.
 * - When switching `input type="text"` to `input type="date"` for mobile, we need to remove the ARIA attributes. The native rendering doesn't require these.
 *   - On the element with the class `slds-combobox`, please remove `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup`.
 *   - On the `input` that we just added `type="date"` to, please remove `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and `role="textbox"`.
 *
 * @summary A datepicker is a text input to capture a date. You can select a single date, date range or date and time.
 *
 * @base
 * @name datepickers
 * @selector .slds-datepicker
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category experience
 * @type data-entry
 * @role grid, combobox
