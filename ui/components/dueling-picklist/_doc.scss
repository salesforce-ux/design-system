 * #### Accessibility
 * This component is essentially 2 ARIA listboxes side by side, so we follow the [ARIA practices guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox) to help implement their interaction in an accessible way. Some additional details, supplementary to the ARIA guide include:
 *
 * **Notable attributes**
 * - `aria-multiselectable="true"` should be set on each listbox
 * - `aria-selected` should be placed on each `role="option`, and only set to `true` when selected
 * - `aria-labelledby` is used to identify the list to the user and should point to the list label
 * - `aria-describedby` is used to provide operation instructions for the Drag and Drop interaction
 * - `tabindex` should be set to "0" when an item is selected and "-1" otherwise
 *
 * **Focus management**
 * - Initially, nothing should be selected and the first item in each list should have `tabindex="0"`
 * - When an item is focused, it becomes selected
 * - When focus leaves the list, the last selected item remains selected and focusable. When focus returns to the list focus is placed on the last selected item.
 * - When moving items:
 *   - With the move button: the items are unselected and added to the target list. The focus should remain on the move button.
 *   - With a keyboard shortcut: focus remains on the item, but in the target list. Since the item is focused, it is also selected.
 *   - If there are already selected items in the target list, they stay selected and the new items are added below them.
 *
 * **Keyboard navigation**
 * - Each list is a tab stop. This provides identification and operation instruction as provided by `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`. State of the overall list is also provided, including total number and number of selected options in the list when focused.
 * - Because we support drag and drop re-ordering, we implement the second multi-select keyboard model.
 *   - `up` and `down` arrows move focus _and_ selection, with `aria-selected="true"`. Any previously selected items are deselected.
 *   - `shift + up` and `shift + down` move focus and creates addition selections
 *   - `ctrl + down` or `ctrl + up` moves focus but selection remains where it is
 *   - `ctrl + space` toggles selection on the focused option, in addition to previous selections
 *   - `ctrl + a` selects all options in the list
 *   - `cmd/ctrl + right` and `cmd/ctrl + left` Moves selected items between lists
 *   - `space` toggles "Drag and Drop" mode. When in "Drag and Drop" mode:
 *     - `up` and `down` arrows move the selected items _within_ the current list
 *
 * **Updating operation and state**
 * - The content in the `option-drag-label` assistive text should provide clear instructions on how to drag and drop with a keyboard
 * - The `aria-live` region should update as items are moved to provide context about the state and location of the items
 *
 * @summary Dueling picklist are used to move options between two lists. The list options can be re-ordered.
 *
 * @base
 * @name dueling-picklist
 * @selector .slds-dueling-list
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category experience
 * @type data-entry
 * @role listbox
 * @s1 false
