/**
 * You can style the HTML `<input>` element to align with the Salesforce brand
 * by using the `.slds-input` class on the `<input>` element.
 *
 * The `<input>` element includes support for all HTML5 types: `text`,
 * `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`,
 * `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`.
 *
 * The static state is for form elements that can’t be modified by the user. It is used for small, non-editable form fields that sit next to inputs and allows the size and height to align. It is not meant for large paragraphs of text.
 *
 * ##### Pointer Events
 *
 * In order to have an actionable SVG within the input, like a clear
 * or increment/decrement button, the icon must be contained within
 * a button, not an anchor `<a>`, in order for pointer events to work properly.
 * You can see examples of the correct markup in the [Left Icon & Clear Button example](../input/?example=double-icon&variant=base)
 * or the [Counter example](../input/?example=increment-decrement-counter&variant=base).
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Inputs with errors should have `aria-describedby` to insure that the
 * associated field level error message is read by assistive technology.
 * If the error message has an `id="my-error-message"`, then the input should
 * have `aria-describedby="my-error-message"`.
 *
 * If you need some type of field level help and if your tooltips are
 * available on hover, make sure they’re also available on keyboard focus. The
 * help icon needs to be associated to the tooltip so that when the user focuses
 * on the icon, assistive technology reads out the content of the tooltip. If
 * the tooltip has an `id="help"`, then the `<button>` containing the icon should
 * have `aria-describedby="help"`.
 *
 * In some cases, the read-only field state is swapped and has no `<input>`. This is called `static` in the examples. In that case, don’t use a `<label>`. This provides better accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigators. Instead, use a `<span>` with the `.slds-form-element__label` class. Instead of an `<input>`, use the `.slds-form-element__static` class inside the `.slds-form-element__control` wrapper.
 *
 * ##### Fixed Text
 *
 * When using the fixed text variants for prepending or appending symbols to inputs,
 * please be sure to use `aria-labelledby` on the input, that points to the ids of the label,
 * prepended text and appended text as a space separated list. The IDs must appear in that order:
 * label, prepended, then appended.
 *
 * The reason we do this is to create a better association between the input and the supporting labels around it.
 * By only using the traditional `label[for]` method, the fixed text is never read out in the context of editing
 * the input value. With using the `aria-labelledby` attribute we can create a better label with all the
 * visual labels associated with it, in a relevant order, that is read by assistive technology when the user
 * needs it; when they're editing the value.
