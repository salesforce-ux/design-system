/**
 * To create a pill, apply the `.slds-pill` class on a `span`. Inside, place either a `span` or an `a` with the `.slds-pill__label` class around the text.
 *
 * Additionally, a pill can have an icon or image that sits to the left-hand side of the `.slds-pill__label`. That icon or image should receive the class `.slds-pill__icon`.
 *
 * You may also want the functionality to remove the pill as a selection. An "X" icon is normally used and will sit to the right-hand side of the `.slds-pill__label`. That icon should receive the class `.slds-pill__remove`.
 *
 * A `.slds-pill_container` can be used as a visual container for multiple pill(s).
 *
 * @summary A pill represents an object that can be viewed with or without an icon
