/**
 * The progress indicator communicates to the user which step of a process they
 * may be on. The length of the progress bar can be changed by modifying the
 * value on `<progress class="slds-progress-bar" />` with JavaScript. The
 * `.slds-progress-bar` accepts a range from 0% to 100%.
 *
 * When a step becomes active, the `.slds-progress__item` should get the class
 * `.slds-is-active`. This class should be applied through JavaScript. When the
 * step is completed, the `.slds-is-active` class should be replaced with the
 * class `.slds-is-completed` on `.slds-progress__item`. At that point, the
 * `.slds-progress__item` element should receive a "success" icon, providing
 * feedback that the step has been completed.
 *
