/**
 * The discussion feed publisher is found at the top of a feed stream. It contains
 * basic and advanced publishing capibilities.
 *
 * The discussion feed is in a collapsed state by default. There are 3 states
 * of the discussion feed that provide different feedback to the user. First,
 * the collapsed state, this indicates the user has not interacted with the
 * discussion feed publisher. When the user initiates an interaction with the
 * publisher, by either focusing of the textara or clicking the "Share" button,
 * through javascript the class of `slds-is-active` should be applied to the
 * `slds-publisher` div. This class will expand the publisher box and display
 * additional publisher actions.
 *
 * During the active state, before the user has begun typing or attaching
 * additional content, the "Share" button should be disabled by applying the
 * `disabled` attribute to the `<textarea>`. When the user begins typing, the
 * `disabled` attribute should be toggled off.
