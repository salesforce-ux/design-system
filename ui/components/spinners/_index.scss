/**
 * To use the spinner in a component, the parent of the spinner should be set to `position:relative`. You can use the utility class `.slds-is-relative` or add the declaration to your custom component CSS. If you are using the spinner in an `iframe` and dynamically loading DOM nodes after the page has loaded, it is recommended that you set the `.slds-spinner_container` to `position:fixed` so that it remains centered in the viewport.
 *
 * The background overlay for the spinner is an optional element.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * A spinner should have the Aria `role="status"` and contain assistive text that explains what is currently happening.
 *
 * @summary Spinners are CSS loading indicators that should be shown when retrieving data or performing slow computations. In some cases, the first time a parent component loads, a stencil is preferred to indicate network activity.
 *
 * @base
 * @name spinners
 * @selector .slds-spinner_container
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category feature
 * @type loading
 * @role alert
