/**
 * Tiles are setup to be displayed with or without an image/icon. The default
 * pattern for tiles has an image/icon, a detail body which contains a list of
 * information and action overflow menu dropdown. The detail body list, by
 * default, comes as a name/value pairing but can be swapped out with a string
 * of text or an inline horizontal list.
 *
 * Tiles can have different groupings of information based on its context.
 * Pay close attention to the markup, as each tile layout is constructed differently.
 *
 * @summary A tile is a grouping of related information associated with a record.
 *
 * @base
 * @name tiles
 * @selector .slds-tile
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category structure
 * @type data-display
