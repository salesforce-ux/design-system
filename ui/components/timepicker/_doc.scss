/**
 * #### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 *
 * A timepicker is used to select a single time. The component is using the combobox HTML structure and has the following markup requirements:
 *
 * **Desktop**
 * - Add `.slds-is-open` to the element with `.slds-dropdown-trigger` to invoke the dropdown that contains the list of time options.
 * - The `.slds-has-focus` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has focus.
 * - The `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has been selected.
 *
 * **Mobile**
 * - When on mobile, we want to leverage the native timepicker by changing the `input` type from `text` to `time`
 * - When switching `input type="text"` to `input type="time"` for mobile, we need to remove the ARIA attributes. The native rendering doesn't require these.
 *   - On the element with the class `slds-combobox`, please remove `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup`.
 *   - On the `input` that we just added `type="time"` too, please remove `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and `role="textbox"`.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Please follow the implementation guildelines found under [Combobox](/components/combobox)
