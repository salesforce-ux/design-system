<div className="doc lead">
  Cards are used to apply a container around a related grouping of information.
</div>

## Structuring a Card

To initialize a card, apply the `lwc-card` class to an `article` element.

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Accessibility Note">
  Cards should use an underlying <code className="doc">article</code> element to maintain usability for some screen reader users.
</Blockquote>

A card is made up of 3 sections, a header, a body, and a footer. The header and footer have limitations, but the body section can accommodate any layout of related information.

<CodeView hideSourceOf={['icon']}>
  {CardExamples.default}
</CodeView>

## Custom Elements and Shadow Boundaries

The Card component should only have one shadow boundary that contains the header, the body, and the footer. The body should have an open `slot` for children components.

<CodeBlock toggleCode={false}>
  <Card title="Card Title" hasActions hasPadding={false}>
    Body content here
  </Card>
</CodeBlock>

## Implementation Guidelines

## Examples

### Card with header actions

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(CardExamples.examples, 'with-actions')}
</CodeView>

#### Card with border boundary

- `slds-card_boundary` — Applies a simple border with no box-shadow to the boundary of a Card.

##### Usage

Should _ONLY_ be used when a card is nested inside of another card.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(CardExamples.examples, 'card-boundary')}
</CodeView>

#### Card with no border (Bare card)

- `slds-card_bare` — Removes the border and box-shadow from the boundary of a Card.

##### Usage

Should _ONLY_ be used when a card is nested inside of another card. This is the default styling of nested Cards.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(CardExamples.examples, 'bare')}
</CodeView>

### Header

The Card header can have an icon, a title and actions. The icon and title are located on the left, while the actions row is located on the right side of the card header.

<CodeView>
  <Card custom>
    <CardHeader
      title="Accounts"
    />
  </Card>
</CodeView>

### Body

The card body accommodates any layout or design, as long as its a grouping of related information. By default, the Card's body bleeds to the edges of the Card's boundary.

#### Padded

- `lwc-card__body_padded` — Apply to the Card body when the component requires the content of the body to have padding and not to the edges of the Card's boundary.

##### Usage

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(CardExamples.examples, 'full-bleed')}
</CodeView>

### Footer

The card footer is optional and should _**only**_ have a "View All" link that takes a user to the object list view.

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Accessibility Note">
  When present, the footer includes hidden assistive text to give screen reader users context about which entity they will be viewing.
</Blockquote>

#### With no footer

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(CardExamples.examples, 'has-no-footer')}
</CodeView>

#### With a footer

<CodeView>
  {CardExamples.default}
</CodeView>
