/**
 * To float an element on the left, add the `.slds-float--left` class to the element. To float it on the right, add the `.slds-float--right` class.
 *
 * Note: The floated element must be first in the document flow, even if it renders on the right.
 *
 * If you want the parent of the floated element to contain the floats, add the `.slds-clearfix` class to the parent.
 *
 * @summary Use a float to pull an element out of the document’s normal flow and to align it with the left or right side of the container.
