/**
 * Spacing indicates `margin` and `padding`. The base unit of all our spacing metrics is **4**.
 *
 * - Most components already come with spacing included. These utility classes are for added convenience in laying out components.
 * - Classes prefixed in `slds-p-` are used for adding **padding**. Classes prefixed by `slds-m-` are used for adding [margins](/utilities/margin).
 * - The directions available for the spacing classes are `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
 * - You can use the `vertical` shortcut for both `top` and `bottom`, `horizontal` for both `right` and `left`, and `around` for all sides.
 * - Use the `_xxx-small` through `_xx-large` scale to choose the size needed.
 * - Where **vertical centering** is required, check out our [centered media object](/utilities/media-objects) instead of applying extra `margin` or `padding`.
